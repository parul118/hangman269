# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess each letter correctly before they run out of lives.
